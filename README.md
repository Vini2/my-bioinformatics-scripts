# my-scripts
This repository consists of scripts that I need for my day-to-day work. The scripts consist of code that I need to work with bioinformatics data in my projects. 

Listed below are the scripts available.
* Convert a given set of fastq sequences to fasta sequences
* Count the number of fasta sequences
* Remove small fasta sequences which are shorter than a given length
* Separate paired end reads into two files
* Separate a set of sequences into individual files
* Sort files in the order humans expect
